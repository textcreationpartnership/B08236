            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>My honorable good Lord, ≈øuch a day of the moneth there came a Subpoena from your Honours, to enter my appearance in this Court; which being entred, I tooke forth a coppy of the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being taken, I was to draw my An≈øwer, which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to doe, but being ≈øhutt up clo≈øe pri≈øoner, I was de≈øerted of all meanes by which I ≈øhould have done it; for I was no ≈øooner ≈øerved with the Subpoena, but I was ≈øhortly after ≈øhutt up clo≈øe pri≈øoner, with a ≈øu≈øpention of pen, inke and paper; which clo≈øe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øonment did eate up ≈øuch a deale of my time, that I was hindred the bringing in of my An≈øwer: You did a≈ø≈øigne me Coun≈øell, t'is true, but they neglected to come to me, and I could not come to them, being under lock and key: Then upon motion in Court, yee gave me liberty to goe to them; but then pre≈øently after that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (I know not for what cau≈øe, nor upon who≈øe commaund) I was ≈øhutt up againe: And then I could not compell my Coun≈øell to come to me, and my time was ≈øhort, and I had neither pen nor inke, nor Servant to doe any thing for me, for my Servant was then al≈øo kept clo≈øe pri≈øoner under a Pur≈øevants hands; this was to put impo≈ø≈øibilities upon mee. Then upon a ≈øecond motion for pen and inke (which was graunted me) I drew up ≈øome In≈øtructions, and in a fortnight time ≈øent 40 ≈øheetes to my Coun≈øell; ≈øuddainly after I drew up 40 ≈øheetes more, and ≈øent to them; My Lord, I did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by the advi≈øe of my Coun≈øell, by whom I was ruled in the drawing up of all my An≈øwer, and payd him twice for drawing it, and ≈øome of my Coun≈øell would have ≈øet their hands to it.

And with whom doth the Lord con≈øult, when hee came downe? with his Servant Abraham, and hee gives the rea≈øon; for I know (≈øayth hee) that Abraham will commaund his children and hou≈øehold after him, that they ≈øhall keep the way of the Lord to doe Iu≈øtice and Iudgement. My good Lords, thus ≈øtands the ca≈øe betweene your Honours and us this day; There is a great cry come up into your eares, again≈øt us, from the Kings Attorney; why now be you plea≈øed to de≈øcend and ≈øee if the crime be according to the cry, and con≈øult (with God) (not the Prelates being the adver≈øary part, and (as it is apparant to all the World) doe proudly ≈øet them≈øelves again≈øt the wayes of God, and from whom none can expect Iu≈øtice or Iudgement) but with righteous men, that will be impartiall on either ≈øide, before you proceed to Cen≈øure, which Cen≈øure you cannot pa≈ø≈øe on us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great inju≈øtice before you heare our An≈øwers read: Here is my An≈øwer, which I here tender upon my oath; My good Lords, give us leave to ≈øpeake in our owne defence; wee are not con≈øcious to our ≈øelves of any thing wee have done that de≈øerves a Cen≈øure this day in this Honourable Court, but that wee have ever laboured to maintaine the Honor, Dignity, and Prerogative Royall of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Lord the King, Let my Lord the King live forever.

I dare undertake, that ≈øcarce any one of your Lord≈øhips have read my Bookes; And can you then Cen≈øure me for what you know not, and before I have made my defence? O my Noble Lords! Is this righteous Iudgement? This were again≈øt the Law of God and man, to condemne a man, before you know his crime. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour before whom S.

The fir≈øt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:185117:9"/>of my trouble was by the Prelates, for writing a Booke again≈øt the Pope, and the Pope of Canterbury ≈øayd I wrote again≈øt him, and therefore que≈øtioned mee: But if the Pre≈ø≈øes were as open to us, as formerly they have beene, we would ≈øhatter his Kingdome about his eares: But be yee not deterred by their power, neither be affrighted at our ≈øufferings; Let none determine to turne from the wayes of the Lord, but goe on, fight couragiou≈øly again≈øt Gog and Magog. I know there be many here who have ≈øet many dayes apart for our behalfe, (let the Prelates take notice of it) and they have ≈øent up ≈øtrong prayers to heaven for us, wee feele the ≈øtrength and benefit of them at this time; I would have you to take notice of it; wee have felt the ≈øtrength and benefit of your prayers all along this cau≈øe. In a word, ≈øo farre I am from ba≈øe feare, or caring for any thing they can doe, or ca≈øt upon mee, that had I as much blood as would ≈øwell the Theames, I would ≈øhedd it every droppe in this cau≈øe. Therefore be not any of you di≈øcouraged, be not daunted at their power, ever labouring to pre≈øerve Innocency, and keep peace within, goe on in the ≈øtrength of your God, and he will never fayle you, in ≈øuch a day as this; As I ≈øayd before, ≈øo I ≈øay againe; Had I as many lives as I have heires on my head, or dropps of blood in my veynes, I would give them up all for this cau≈øe. This plot of ≈øending vs to tho≈øe remote places, was fir≈øt con≈øulted and agitated by the Ie≈øuites, as I can make it plainely appeare. O ≈øee what times wee are fallen into, that the Lords mu≈øt ≈øit to act the Ie≈øuites plots! For our owne parts wee owe no malice to the per≈øons of any of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, but would lay our necks under their feet to doe them good as they are men, but again≈øt the u≈øurpation of their power, as they are Bi≈øhops, wee doe profe≈ø≈øe our ≈øelves enemies till doomes day.</p>

            <p>The cau≈øe (≈øayd M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Prynne) of my ≈øtanding here,<note place="margin">M. Prynne</note> is for not bringing in my An≈øwer, for which my cau≈øe is taken <hi>pro confe≈ø≈øo</hi> again≈øt mee. What endeavours I u≈øed for the bringing in thereof, that, God and my owne con≈øcience, and my Coun≈øell knowes, who≈øe cowardi≈øe ≈øtands upon Record to all ages. For rather then I will have my cau≈øe a leading cau≈øe, to deprive the Subjects of that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:185117:10"/>liberty which I ≈øeeke to maintaine, I rather expo≈øe my per≈øon to a leading example, to beare this puni≈øhment: And I be≈øeech you all to take notice of their proceedings in this cau≈øe. When I was ≈øerved with a Subpoena into this Court, I was ≈øhut up clo≈øe pri≈øoner, that I could have no acce≈ø≈øe to Coun≈øell, nor admitted pen, inke or paper to draw up my An≈øwer by my In≈øtructions, for which I feed them twice (though to no purpo≈øe) yet when all was done, my An≈øwer would not be accepted into the Court, though I tendered it upon my oath. I appeale to all the world, if this were a legall or ju≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Our accu≈øation is in point of Libell (but ≈øuppo≈øedly) again≈øt the Prelates. To cleare this now I will give you a little light, what the Law is in point of Libell (of which profe≈ø≈øion I have ≈øometimes beene, and ≈øtill profe≈ø≈øe my ≈øelfe to have ≈øome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in) you ≈øhall finde in ca≈øe of Libell, two Statutes: The one in the ≈øecond of Queen Mary; The other in the ≈øeaventh of Queen Elizabeth. That in the ≈øecond of Queen Mary, the extremity and heighth of it runs thus: That if a Libeller doth goe ≈øo farre and ≈øo high as to Libell again≈øt King or Queen by denomination, the higth and extremity of the Law is; that they lay no greater fine on him then an hundred pounds, with a moneths impri≈øonment; and no corporall puni≈øhment, except he doe refu≈øe to pay his fine; and then to inflict ≈øome puni≈øhment in liewe of that fine at the moneths end: Neither was this Cen≈øure to be pa≈ø≈øed on him, except it were fully prooved by two witne≈ø≈øes, who were to produce a certificat of their good demeanor for the credit of their report, or el≈øe confe≈ø≈øed by the Libeller. You ≈øhall finde in that Statute 7. Eliz. ≈øome further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the former of 2. Mariae, and that onely in point of fine and puni≈øhment; and it mu≈øt ≈øtill reach as high as the per≈øon of King and Queen. Here this Statute doth ≈øet a fine of two hundred pounds; the other, but one: This ≈øets three moneths impri≈øonment; the former but one: So that therein onely they differ. But in this they both agree, namely, at the end of his impri≈øonment to pay his fine, and ≈øo to goe free without any further que≈øtioning: But if hee refu≈øe to pay his fine, then the Court is to inflict ≈øome puni≈øhment on him corre≈øpondent to his fine. Now ≈øee the di≈øparity betweene tho≈øe times of theirs, and ours. A Libeller in Queen Maries time was fined but an hundred pounds, in Queen Elizabeths time two
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:185117:10"/>hundred: In Queen Maries dayes but a moneths impri≈øonment; in Queen Elizabeths three moneths; and not ≈øo great a fine, if they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled not again≈øt King or Queen. Formerly the greate≈øt fine was but two hundred pounds, though again≈øt King or Queen; Now five thou≈øand pounds, though but again≈øt the Prelates, and that but ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øedly, which cannot be prooved: Formerly, but three moneths impri≈øonment; Now perpetuall impri≈øonment: Then, upon paying the fine, no corporall puni≈øhment was to be inflicted: But now, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous puni≈øhment with the lo≈ø≈øe of blood and all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances that may aggravate it. See now what times wee are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, when that Libelling (if it were ≈øo) again≈øt Prelates onely, ≈øhall fall higher, then if it touched Kings and Princes.</p>
            <p>That which I have to ≈øpeake of next, is this: The Prelates find them≈øelves exceedingly agrieved and vexed again≈øt what wee have written concerning the u≈øurpation of their calling, where indeed wee declare their calling not to be <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> I make no doubt, but there are ≈øome Intelligencers or Abbettors within the hearing, whom I would have well to know and take notice of what I now ≈øay. I here in this place make this offer to them, That if I may be admitted a fayre di≈øpute, on fayre termes, for my cau≈øe; that I will maintaine, and doe here make the challenge again≈øt all the Prelates in the Kings Dominions, and again≈øt all the Prelates in Chri≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (let them take in the Pope, and all to help them) that their calling is not <hi>Iure Divino.</hi> I will ≈øpeake it againe; I make the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng again≈øt all the Prelates in the Kings Dominions, and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtendome to maintaine, that their calling is not <hi>Iure Divino.</hi> If I make it not good, let me be hanged up at the Hall-Gate: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the people gave a great ≈øhout.</p>
            <p>The next thing that I am to ≈øpeake of, is this: The Prelates find them≈øelves exceedingly agrieved and vext again≈øt what I have written in point of Law, concerning their Writs and Proces, That the ≈øending forth of Writs and Proces in their owne name, is again≈øt all Law and Iu≈øtice, and doth entrench on his Maje≈øties Prerogative Royall, and the Subjects Liberties. And here now I make a ≈øecond challeng again≈øt all the Lawyers in the Kingdome in way of fayre Di≈øpute, That I will maintaine, the Prelates ≈øending forth of Writs and Proces in their owne names, to be again≈øt all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:185117:11"/>Law and Iu≈øtice, and entrencheth on his Maje≈øties Prerogative Royall, and the Subjects Liberty. Lea≈øt it ≈øhould be forgotten, I ≈øpeake it againe, I here challeng all the whole Society of the Law upon a fayre Di≈øpute to maintaine, That the ≈øending forth of Writs and Proces in the Prelates owne names, to be again≈øt all Law and Iu≈øtice, and entrencheth on the Kings Prerogative Royall, and the Subjects Liberty. If I be not able to make it good, let me be put to the tormentinge≈øt death they can devi≈øe.</p>
            <p>Wee pray≈øe the Lord, wee feare none but God and the King: Had wee re≈øpected our Liberties, wee had not ≈øtood here at this time: it was for the generall good and Liberties of you all that wee have now thus farre engaged our owne Liberties in this cau≈øe. For did you know, how deepely they have entrenched on your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties in point of Popery; If you knew but into what times you are ca≈øt, it would make you looke about you: And if you did but ≈øee what changes and revolutions of per≈øons, cau≈øes and actions, have beene made by one man, you would more narrowly looke into your Previledges, and ≈øee how farre your Liberty did lawfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and ≈øo maintaine it.</p>
            <p>This is the ≈øecond time that I have beene brought to this place, who hath beene the Author of it, I thinke you all well know: For the fir≈øt time, If I could have had leave given me, I could ea≈øily have cleered my ≈øelf of that which was then layd to my charge: As al≈øo I could have done now, if I might have beene permitted to ≈øpeake, That Booke for which I ≈øuffered formerly, e≈øpecially for ≈øome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular words therein written, which I quoted out of Gods Word and auncient Fathers, for which notwith≈øtanding, they pa≈ø≈øed Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure on me; That ≈øame Booke was twice licen≈øed by publike Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the ≈øame words I then ≈øuffered for, they are againe made u≈øe of, and applyed in the ≈øame ≈øence by Heylin in his Booke lately printed, and dedicated to the King, and no exceptions taken again≈øt them, but are very well taken.</p>

Then being put into the Pillary, hee ≈øayd: Good people, I am brought hither to be a ≈øpectacle to the world, to Angells, and men; And how≈øoever I ≈øtand here to undergoe the puni≈øhment of a Rogue, yet except to be a faithfull Servant to Chri≈øt, and a loyall Subject to the King, be the property of a Rogue, I am no Rogue.

After a while, hee having a No≈øegay in his hand, a Bee came and pitched on the No≈øegay, and began to ≈øuck the flowers very ≈øavourly, which hee beholding and well ob≈øerving, ≈øayd, Doe yee not ≈øee this poore Bee?

All our ≈øufferings be but fleabitings to that hee endured, hee endured the Cro≈ø≈øe, and de≈øpi≈øed the ≈øhame, and is ≈øet on the right hand of God: Hee is a mo≈øt excellent pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for us to looke upon, that treading his ≈øtepps, and ≈øuffering with him, wee may be glorified with him. And what can we ≈øuffer, wherein hee hath not gonne before us, even in the ≈øame kinde? Was hee not degraded, when they ≈øcornefully put on him a purple Robe, a Reed into his hand, a thorny Crowne upon his head, ≈øalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him with Hayle King of the Iewes, and ≈øo di≈ørobed him againe? Was not hee deprived, when they ≈ømote the Shepherd, and the Sheepe were ≈øcattered? Was not violence offered to his ≈øacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, when hee was buffited, and ≈øcourged, his hands and his feet peirced, his head pricked with thornes, his ≈øide goared with a Speare &amp;c.? Was not the Cro≈ø≈øe more ≈øhamefull, yea and more painfull then a Pillary? Was not hee ≈øtript of all hee had, when hee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:185117:14"/>was left ≈øtarke naked upon the Cro≈ø≈øe, the Souldiers dividing his garments, and ca≈øting lots upon his ve≈øture? And was hee not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to perpetuall clo≈øe impri≈øonment in mans imagination, when his body was layd in a Tombe, and the Tombe ≈øealed, lea≈øt hee ≈øhould breake pri≈øon, or his Di≈øciples ≈øteale him away? And yet did hee not ri≈øe againe, and thereby brought deliverance and victory to us all, ≈øo as wee are more then Conquerors through him that loved us? Here then wee have an excellent Patterne indeed. And all this hee uttered (and what≈øoever el≈øe hee ≈øpake) with marvailous ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity.</p>
                        <p>One ≈øayd unto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Burton, Chri≈øt will not be a≈øhamed of you at the la≈øt day. Hee replied, Hee knew whom hee had believed, and that Chri≈øt was able to keepe that he had committed to him again≈øt that day. One a≈øked him how hee did? Hee ≈øayd, never better, I ble≈ø≈øe God, who hath accounted mee worthy thus to ≈øuffer. The Keeper keeping off the people from pre≈ø≈øing neere the Pillary; hee ≈øayd, Let them come and ≈øpare not, that they may learne to ≈øuffer. This ≈øame Keeper, being weary, and ≈øitting him downe, a≈øked M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Burton, if hee were well, and bad him be of good comfort. To whom hee replied, Are you well? If you be well, I am much more, and full of comfort, I ble≈ø≈øe God. Some a≈øked him, if the Pillary were not unea≈øy for his neck and ≈øhoulders. Hee an≈øwered: How can Chri≈øts yoake be unea≈øy? This is Chri≈øts yoake, and hee beares the heavier end of it, and I the lighter, and if myne were too heavy, hee would beare that too. O good people, Chri≈øt is a good and ≈øweet Ma≈øter, and worth the ≈øuffering for! And if the world did but know his goodnes, and had ta≈øted of his ≈øweetnes, all would come and be his Servants; and did they but know what a ble≈ø≈øed thing it were to beare his yoake, O who would not beare it? The Keeper going about to ea≈øe the Pillary by putting a ≈øtone or a bricke batt betweene, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Burton ≈øayd, Trouble not your ≈øelf, I am at very good ea≈øe, and feele no wearine≈ø≈øe at all: And e≈øpying a young man at the foote of the Pillary, and perceiving him to looke pale on him; Hee ≈øayd, Sonne, Sonne, what is the matter you looke ≈øo pale? I have as much comfort as my heart can hold, and if I had need of more, I ≈øhould have it. One a≈øked him a while after, if hee would drinke ≈øome <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi> To whom he replied, that he needed it not; for I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:185117:14"/>have, ≈øayd hee, (laying his hand upon his brea≈øt) the true water of life, which like a well doth ≈øpring up to eternall life. Paw≈øing a while, hee ≈øayd with a mo≈øt cheerefull and grave countenance, I was never in ≈øuch a Pulpit before, but litle doe yee know (≈øpeaking to them that ≈øtood about him) what fruits God is able to produce from this drye tree; They looking ≈øtedfa≈øtly upon him, hee ≈øayd, Marke my words and remember them well, I ≈øay, Little doe you know, what fruites God is able to produce from this dry tree, I ≈øay, remember it well, for this day will never be forgotten; and through the≈øe holes (poynting to the Pillary) God can bring light to his Church. The Keeper going about againe to mend the Pillary, hee ≈øayd, Doe not trouble your ≈øelf ≈øo much: But indeed wee are the troublers of the world. By and by after, ≈øome of them offering him a cup of wine; Hee thanked them, telling them, hee had the wine of con≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation within him, and the joyes of Chri≈øt in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, which the world could not take away from him, neither could it give them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Then he looked towards the other Pillary, and making a ≈øigne with his hand, cheerefully called to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ba≈øtwicke, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Prynne, a≈øking them how they did. Who an≈øwered, Very well. A woman ≈øayd unto him, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. every Chri≈øtian is not worthy this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, which the Lord hath ca≈øt upon you this day. Alas (≈øayd hee) who is worthy of the lea≈øt mercy? But it is his gracious favour and free gift, to account us worthy in the behalf of Chri≈øt to ≈øuffer any thing for his ≈øake? Another woman ≈øayd, There are many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds which by Gods a≈ø≈øi≈øtance would willingly ≈øuffer, for the cau≈øe you ≈øuffer for this day. To whom he ≈øayd, Chri≈øt exalts all of us that are ready to ≈øuffer afflictions for his Name with meekenes and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: But Chri≈øts military di≈øcipline in the u≈øe of his ≈øpirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare in point of ≈øuffering, is quite forgotten, and wee have in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner lo≈øt the power of Religion, in not denying our ≈øelves and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chri≈øt a≈øwell in ≈øuffering, as in doing. After a while M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Burton calling to one of his friends for a Handkercher, returned it againe, ≈øaying it is hott, but Chri≈øt bore the burthen in the heate of the day; Let us alwayes labour to approove our ≈øelves to God in all things, and unto Chri≈øt, for therein ≈øtands our happines, come of it what will in this world.</p>

For though I am a poore ≈øinfull wretch, yet I ble≈ø≈øe God for my innocent con≈øcience in any ≈øuch crime as is layd again≈øt mee; and were not my cau≈øe good, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience ≈øound, I could not enjoy ≈øo much un≈øpeakeable comfort in this my ≈øuffering as I doe, I ble≈ø≈øe my God. M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi>. Burton ≈øends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to him by a friend: Hee returned the like to her, ≈øaying, Commend my love to my wife, and tell her, I am heartely cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and bidd her remember what I ≈øayd to her in the morning, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, That ≈øhee ≈øhould not blemi≈øh the glory of this day with one teare, or ≈øo much as one ≈øigh. She returned an≈øwer, that ≈øhee was glad to heare him ≈øo cheerefull; and that ≈øhee was more cheerefull of this day, then of her wedding day. This an≈øwer exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced his heart, who thereupon ble≈ø≈øed God for her, and ≈øayd of her, Shee is but a young Souldier of Chri≈øts, but ≈øhee hath already endured many a ≈øharpe brunt, but the Lord will ≈øtrengthen her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end: And hee having on a payre of new gloves, ≈øhewed them to his freinds there about him, ≈øaying, My wife ye≈øterday of her owne accord bought me the≈øe wedding gloves, for this is my wedding day.</p>
                        <p>Many freinds ≈øpake comfortably to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

One ≈øayd to him, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. by this Sermon (your ≈øuffering) God may convert many unto him. Hee an≈øwered, God is able to doe it indeed.

Chri≈øts blood is a purging blood, but mine is corrupted &amp; polluted with ≈øinne. One freind a≈øking another ≈øtanding neere M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Which though it be not drawen up in ≈øo elegant a≈øtraine as it was delivered and de≈øerved, nor all the Heavenly words and eloquent ≈øpeeches recorded, which were uttered by the≈øe Three Worthies of the Lord, both in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of the Lords them≈øelves at their Cen≈øure, and al≈øo at the place of Execution: Yet I earne≈øtly be≈øeech you in the bowels of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, that you doe not in the lea≈øt manner under-value the glory and dignity, either of the per≈øons, or the cau≈øe, but rather lay the blame upon the rudenes and meane capacity of the Compo≈øer, who is an unfeyned Well-wi≈øher to them both.</p>
